# maze-solver
A few algorithms that solves image-formatted mazes

## About

This is a personal project, based on Mike Pound's idea from Computerphile, that was meant to be a programming exercise.
Currently breadthfirst and depthfirst search has been implemented - change the import and method-calls from solve.py to
change between them. Other algorithms like Dijkstra or A-star might come in the future.

## Note

There are some rules that the mazes needs to follow:
- Input images are .pngs that consists only of black and white pixels
- Black pixels are walls, white pixels are paths
- The maze is enclosed by walls
- The maze has 1 entrance at the top row and 1 exit at the bottom row

Some example inputs and outputs are in the /mazes folder. The mazes are generated using the software [Daedalus](http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/daedalus.htm).

The larger mazes require high amounts of RAM. Currently the 15kx15k maze is unsolved with 16GB of available memory.


Numpy and PIL for Python3 are required to run the program.
Get them on Ubuntu:

`sudo apt-get install python3-numpy`
`sudo apt-get install python3-pil`
